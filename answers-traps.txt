1. Registers a0/a1/a2 contain arguments to functions. a2 register hold 13 for call to printf.
2. The function f is inline and being optimized in main function, the g function is inlined in f.
3. At offset 0x628 after x[ra], ra is set to PC at last instruction.
4. The value of register ra is 0x38, which is 4 bytes after the jalr instruction.
5. The output is "he110 world". If the RISC-V were instead big-endian, i should be set 0x726c6400. 57616 does not need to be change to a different value because the value but not the address is passed to function.
6. The value of register a2 is treated as an integer and will be printed. Inside the function printf, while the iteration of format string meets the second "%d", the function printf will expect the second parameter passed from the caller, which should be in register a2.
